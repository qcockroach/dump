1) what do STC-259, FW, spf stand for ?
    STC-XXX are tasks IDs from Jira board, FW stands for firmware, SPF is the 
    abbriviation for something that I don't remember but it is a new generic SDK 
    package from qualcomm. Anyway, I think you won't deal with SPF at least for 
    some recent time
