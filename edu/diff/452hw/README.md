# Members:

# Programming Language:
C++

# How to execute program:
1) Write a file you'd like to encrypt. <br>
2) In the terminal, type: "make". <br>
3) For the following command format: ./cipher CIPHER NAME KEY ENC/DEC INPUT FILE OUTPUT FILE <br>
CIPHER NAME: Choose either "AES" or "DES". <br>
KEY: If you want to use AES, you need to select a 32 character key (e.g. 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff). <br>
     If you want to use DES, you need to select a 16 character key (e.g. 0123456789abcdef). <br>
ENC/DEC: "ENC" to ENCRYPT and "DEC" to DECRYPT. <br>
INPUT FILE: Name of the file you'd like to encrypt/derypt (e.g. inputfile.txt). <br>
OUTPUT FILE: Name of the file you'd like to write cipher text/plain text (e.g. outputfile.txt). <br>

4) After entering your own arguments into the command format, you will have successfully encrypted/decrypted a file and wrote out the contents into the designated output file.
