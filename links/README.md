# links

  The aim of this project is to collect all plotforsm, neccessary links and data
where I practice and reveal my skills on programming field. Partially to show 
them as my portfolio on interview. I can't save anything on my local machine
that's why I have to save my code and data somewhere. Github's good place to do that.
