When Nikki flew to Germany:

Are you still sleeping?
Rise and shine. A little bird told me you have a big flight today.
EXCITING!
My little birdie's gonna fly to big and wild world to become free as a bird.
Still can't belive, but it's happening IN REAL!
Send me news when you're in.


Wanted to play with words bird, flight and relate them to you,
but couldn't. Fuck it. It wasn't bad attempt.
